# The Universal Equation-Solving Method

## The One Method That Always Works

There is exactly **one** systematic method for solving all pre-algebra equations. It never changes, it never shifts, and it always works. This method is based on a single principle:

> **Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other side.**

This maintains the balance (the equality) and allows you to systematically isolate the variable.

## The Unchanging 5-Step Algorithm

Follow these steps **in this exact order**, every single time:

### Step 1: Simplify Both Sides

**Purpose:** Clean up the equation before you start solving. A simpler equation is easier to work with and reduces errors.

**What to do:**
- **Distribute any parentheses:** Remove parentheses by multiplying each term inside
  - Example: `2(x - 5)` becomes `2·x - 2·5 = 2x - 10`
  - Example: `-3(2x + 1)` becomes `-3·2x + (-3)·1 = -6x - 3`

- **Combine like terms on each side:** Add or subtract terms that have the same variable
  - **Like terms** have the exact same variable part: `3x` and `2x` are like terms
  - `3x + 2x = 5x` (same as `3 apples + 2 apples = 5 apples`)
  - Constants are also like terms: `7 + 3 - 2 = 8`
  - **Unlike terms** cannot be combined: `3x` and `2y` must stay separate

**Key insight:** Simplifying first makes the remaining steps much clearer. Don't skip this step!

---

### Step 2: Move All Variable Terms to One Side

**Purpose:** Collect all the unknown values (variables) together on one side of the equation.

**What to do:**
- Choose which side to collect variables on (usually the side with more variable terms)
- Use **addition** or **subtraction** to move variables to your chosen side
- Remember: Whatever you do to one side, you **must** do to the other

**Example:** `5x + 3 = 2x + 15`
- We have `5x` on the left and `2x` on the right
- Subtract `2x` from **both** sides:
  - Left side: `5x - 2x + 3 = 3x + 3`
  - Right side: `2x - 2x + 15 = 0 + 15 = 15`
  - Result: `3x + 3 = 15`

**Why this works:** Subtracting `2x` from both sides "moves" it from the right to the left. You're not breaking any rules because you're doing the exact same operation to both sides.

**Helpful tip:** If a variable term is negative, you might add to both sides instead. For `3x = -2x + 10`, add `2x` to both sides to get `5x = 10`.

### Step 3: Move All Constant Terms to the Other Side

**Purpose:** Separate the variable from the numbers so you can isolate it in the next step.

**What to do:**
- All **constants** (plain numbers without variables) should be on the **opposite side** from your variable terms
- Use **addition** or **subtraction** to move constants
- Your goal is to reach the form: `(coefficient)x = (number)`

**Example:** `3x + 3 = 15`
- We want to isolate `3x`, so we need to remove the `+3`
- Subtract `3` from **both** sides:
  - Left side: `3x + 3 - 3 = 3x`
  - Right side: `15 - 3 = 12`
  - Result: `3x = 12`

**Why this works:** You're using the **inverse operation** (the opposite). Since `+3` is added to `3x`, you subtract `3` to undo it. Think of it like unpacking a suitcase in reverse order.

**Common mistake:** Forgetting to apply the operation to both sides. If you subtract `3` from the left, you **must** subtract `3` from the right.

---

### Step 4: Isolate the Variable

**Purpose:** Get the variable completely by itself so you can see what it equals.

**What to do:**
- The **coefficient** is the number multiplied by the variable (in `3x`, the coefficient is `3`)
- To isolate `x`, you need to undo the multiplication
- **Divide both sides** by the coefficient, or **multiply both sides** by the reciprocal

**Example 1:** `3x = 12`
- The coefficient is `3`
- Divide both sides by `3`:
  - Left side: `3x ÷ 3 = x`
  - Right side: `12 ÷ 3 = 4`
  - Result: `x = 4`

**Example 2:** `\frac{7}{3}x = 14`
- The coefficient is `\frac{7}{3}`
- Multiply both sides by the **reciprocal** `\frac{3}{7}`:
  - Left side: `\frac{3}{7} · \frac{7}{3}x = \frac{21}{21}x = x`
  - Right side: `14 · \frac{3}{7} = \frac{42}{7} = 6`
  - Result: `x = 6`

**Why this works:** Division and multiplication are inverse operations. If `x` is multiplied by `3`, you divide by `3` to undo it. If `x` is multiplied by a fraction, multiply by the reciprocal (flip the fraction) to undo it.

**Remember:**
- Reciprocal of `\frac{a}{b}` is `\frac{b}{a}`
- Reciprocal of `5` is `\frac{1}{5}` (because `5 = \frac{5}{1}`)
- Multiplying by a reciprocal always gives you `1`, which leaves the variable alone

### Step 5: Verify Your Answer

**Purpose:** Confirm that your solution is actually correct. This catches any arithmetic errors or mistakes you may have made.

**What to do:**
- Take your solution and **substitute** it back into the **original equation** (not a simplified version)
- Calculate what both sides equal
- Both sides **must** give you the same number

**Example:** If you found `x = 4` for the equation `5x + 3 = 2x + 15`:
- Left side: `5(4) + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23`
- Right side: `2(4) + 15 = 8 + 15 = 23`
- Both equal `23` ✓ The answer is correct!

**Why this is critical:**
- Verification proves your answer is right
- If the sides don't match, you know you made an error and need to redo the problem
- It builds confidence in your work

**What if verification fails?**
- Go back and check each step carefully
- Look for arithmetic errors (wrong addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division)
- Make sure you applied operations to **both sides** at every step
- Redo the problem from the beginning if needed

**Never skip this step!** Even experienced mathematicians verify their answers.

## Why This Always Works

Every operation you perform is **reversible** because you're using inverse operations:
- Addition ↔ Subtraction
- Multiplication ↔ Division

The equation stays balanced at every step, guaranteeing that your final answer is correct if you follow the steps precisely.

## The Key Principle

Every single equation you encounter follows the same pattern:

```
Start → Simplify → Move Variables → Move Constants → Isolate → Verify
```

This method **never changes**. Whether you have fractions, negatives, parentheses, or variables on both sides, you follow the exact same steps in the exact same order.

**Trust the method. It always works.**
